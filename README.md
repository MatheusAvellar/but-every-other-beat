# But Every Other Beat Is Missingâ„¢

## What is this?

A machine that would (ideally) allow you to skip every other beat
in any song uploaded, even auto-detecting the uploaded song's BPM.

That, of course, was merely my dream. The actual code here is
literal garbage, and does only a fraction of what I hoped it would.

But hey this has been sitting on my computer for ages, I might
as well throw it on GitHub.

## What does it actually do?

- You can drag any .mp3 file onto it, and it will be played;
- It will **try** to auto detect the BPM of your uploaded .mp3;
- You can manually set the BPM if you think it guessed wrong (it
probably will have);
- You can set an offset to the skipping (e.g. if the .mp3 has a quiet
segment at the start or something)

## Okay, but what does it look like?

I actually really like the style I was going for:

## Neat! What's wrong with it?

- The auto BPM detection doesn't work nearly as well as I hoped it would;
- I don't think `setInterval()` is *that* reliable, which leads to some
inconsistencies;
- The UI needs a huge improvement;
- Perhaps a way to export your beautiful creation would be nice
